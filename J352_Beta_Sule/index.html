The information regarding the University of Maryland’s endowments is protected by a private organization called the University System of Maryland Foundation, which handles the investments of the eleven public Maryland campuses out of the public eye.

In recent months, the University of Maryland’s policy regarding the transparency of its endowments and investments has been called into question by the student body. In light of the recent war in Gaza, the rise in nationwide nonviolent protests calling for a divestment of Israel and Israeli companies has grown. As of April 29, over 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, while an estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Oct 7 attacks, according to the Associated Press. 
<p></p>
According to the USM Foundation Investment Policy, <strong>“The endowment pool is made up of several thousand individual endowment funds that support scholarship, research, faculty, academic programs, and various special initiatives.”</strong>  None of these initiatives are specified in the foundation’s Strategic Plan for 2024. The plan lists its strategies in three overarching commonalities: “Alignment and Partnership,” “Communication and Trust” and “Leadership and Governance.” The plan further narrows these commonalities into vague statements regarding investment choices, such as working within the organization to build trust in higher education. With a goal more intended towards convincing donors to invest in higher education, the question regarding the specific investments the USM Foundation makes remains unanswered. 
<p></p>
The University System of Maryland had a $2.1 billion endowment as of June 2023. More than double the endowment amount from 2022, none of this amount is accounted for in the university system’s investments. The lack of transparency has caused concern over the various uses of those endowments. The origin of the University of Maryland’s endowment of $681 million is protected due to the

Divest UMD is a student and faculty lead initiative with a goal to have the University divest its funds from companies in support of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands. While unconfirmed due to the USM Foundation being private, and therefore immune to the Maryland Public Information Act records requests, these include Lockheed Martin, for whom the Glenn L. Martin Hall is named after.

Divest UMD proposed a bill which calls for the University System Foundation of Maryland to make its investments public information so as to hold the university accountable, and to then divest from companies in violation of human rights. The bill references the university’s notable decision to divest from South African apartheid in 1989 after student-run grassroots organizations campaigned for divestment.
<p></p>
The divestment resolution was brought to the university’s Student Government Association on April 15, and the SGA’s student affair committee voted against a resolution to divestment, according to the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. In response, several students protested through nonviolent sit-ins around campus. 
<p></p>
By April 29, the SJP had organized an indefinite sit-in on the university’s McKeldin Mall in protest against the decision. This follows a wave of student protests across college campuses calling for their universities to divest from companies in support of Israel’s activities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
<p></p>
One of the goals listed in the USM Foundation’s Strategic Plan is to “Evaluate the business model and diversify revenue streams by seeking increased income through expanded assets under management and seeking business operations efficiencies.” While diversifying modes of revenue is listed, the specific companies and organizations are not specifically named. 
<p></p>
According to the SJP’s Instagram account, another goal is for the university to openly condemn the war on Gaza. Currently, the university has condemned antisemitism and acts of terrorism, but has not directly commented on the civilian casualty in Gaza.
